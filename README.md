## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I applied the picture and source element for the first time. Learning that I wanted the value of min-width on the attribute media to be set to the same value as my min-width value on the media query.

As well as that flexbox is useful in many cases to center items within a container. For example the icon and text inside the button is centered using flexbox.
